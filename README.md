    This repo has five implementations of the solution of  "Ehab and another construction problem" for the quiz 5 of algorithms UNAL 2020-1

    * The Brute Force approach (Runs in quadratic time)
    * The Brute Force approach with a condition for an early stop (Still runs in cuadratic time, but better)
    * A better search looking at a list of primes and getting the biggest number that is divisable by it (Runs in "linear" time)
    * A one step approach that outputs the same input as both a and b (Constant time)
    * A one step approach that gets the first number after the inputs half that doubled is grater than the input (Constant time)
